                When students that don't know Phrasal Verbs try to translate sentences like <span class="example">"He was looking for the broom in the dark room."</span>, they usually use their notes or textbook or a dictionary and find out that look means "see". </p>
                <p>Then they get all confused because there is no way you can see anything in a room with no lights. 
                </p>
                <p>The way to fix this is using better notes, or better dictionaries that explain that "look for" means "search". </p>
                <p>There is no way that we can figure out the meaning of <span class="example">"look for"</span> by joining the meaning of "look" and the meaning of "for". </p>
                <p>That just does not work. </p>
                <p> In the next pages we will see some verbs that change meaning completely near certain prepositions.</p>
