	<header><h1>7. Online dictionaries that give good Bengali translations of phrasals.</h1>
      
    </header>
	<main>
    <p>There are some online dictionaries available that may or may not help a student in obtaining the actual / contextual meaning of a phrasal verb who learns English as a second language.</p>
        
        <p>Google Translate is one of the popular resources. But unfortunately it is not cent percent failsafe as of now. You might get unexpected / weird result.</p>
        
        <p>In my personal experience, I have seen some third party Bengali to English Dictionaries on the internet. But to be honest, I am not completely satisfied due to their embedded adwares, trackers, security certificate mismatch, excessive user tracking etc.  </p>
        
        <p>On the Android platform, from Google play store, I tested some Bengali to English Dictionary apps that have some usability but again you cannot not rely on them 100%. Also they might display awkward advertisments during their usage.</p>
        
        <p>A conventional reputed paper Dictionary is a better option here. But not all can afford that in a poor country due to lack of money and scarcity of storage space. </p>
