        <h2>How a Phrasal verb is formed</h2>
        <p>
        English People create Phrasal Verbs by combining two or three words from different categories of English Grammar. <br>
            This combination completely changes the meaning of the individial words.<br><br>
            The usual pattern to combine or form a phrasal verb is the following: <br>
            <span class="example">Example #1: </span> <br>
            <span class="highlight">look after [ verb + preposition ]</span><br>
                        
            In the above example "look" is a verb and "after" is a preposition. <br> But the meaning of "look after" is " to take care". 
            <br><br>
            
            <span class="example">Example #2:</span><br> 
            <span class="highlight">give in [ verb + particle ] </span><br>
            In the above example "give" is a verb and "in" is a "particle". <br> But the meaning of "give in" is " to surrender". <br>
            </p>
            
            <p class="note">
            [Note: A preposition and a particle look similar but they are used differently.<br>
            (i)  The “preposition” (which shows a link or connection) is used in a “prepositional phrase.<br>
            (ii) The “particle” functions as a part of the verb. It changes the meaning of the verb  to form a phrasal verb.]
