        <h2>What's a phrasal verb?</h2>
        <p>
            A phrasal verb is a verb that comes in pieces --  a normal verb, and a preposition. 
        <br>
        <span class="example">Example: </span>"look for",<br> (Same meaning as English "search" and "খোঁজা" in Bengali).
        </p>
     <div style="text-align: left; padding: 10px;">   
        Here <ul><li>"look for" is a phrasal verb.</li>
            <li>"look" is a normal verb, that means same as English "watch"(Bengali "তাকানো").</li>
            <li>"for" is a preposition.</li></ul>
      
       The meaning of " look for " cannot be figured out from the meaning of its two parts. You have to be told that "look" combined with "for" ends up meaning ("খোঁজা"), and that "look" when not so combined means (তাকানো).<br>
            
         <span class="example">Example 1A:</span> Don't look now = (এখন দেখো না। ) &#8592; Here "look" has no "for" and is a normal verb.<br>
         <span class="example">Example 1B:</span> I'm looking for the keys = (আমি চাবিটা খুঁজছি। ) &#8592; here "look for" is a phrasal verb and does not mean looking; it means searching. <br>
         <br>

            <audio controls class="player"><source src="ting.ogg" type="audio/ogg"></audio> 
            <!------------------->
             
      </div>
         <p>       
         <span class="note">  
            The phrasal verbs are very confusing for Bengali  students, because they sometimes see that look means "তাকানো ", and that "for" means  "জন্য", and then they try to figure out the meaning of "look for" from that, and fail horribly, because the true meaning is unrelated. The way to avoid the confusion is finding "look for" using a good English-Bengali dictionary, it will tell you that "look for" means "খোঁজা ".</span>
