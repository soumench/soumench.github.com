        <h2>How a Phrasal verb is formed</h2>
        <p>
        A phrasal verb is a verb that comes in pieces --  a normal verb, and a preposition. 
        <br>
       Example: "look for", (Same meaning as English "search" and "khoja" in Bengali).<br>
       Here "look for" is a phrasal verb.<br>
       "look" is a normal verb, that means same as English "watch", and Bengali "tAkAno".<br>
        "for" is a preposition.<br>
       The meaning of " look for " cannot be figured out from the meaning of its two parts. You have to be told that "look" combined with "for" ends up meaning ("khonjA"), and that "look" when not so combined means (takano).<br>
            
       Example 1A: Don't look now = (XXXX) &#8592; here look has no "for" and is a normal verb.<br>
       Example 1B: I'm looking for the keys = (XXXX) &#8592; here "look for" is a phrasal verb and does not mean looking; it means searching. <br>
            
            The phrasal verbs are very confusing for Bengali  students, because they sometimes see that look means "taakaano", and that for means  "khonjaa", and then they try to figure out the meaning of "look for" from that, and fail horribly, because the true meaning is unrelated. The way to avoid the confusion is finding "look for" in a good English-to-Bengali dictionary, it will tell youthat "look for" means "khonjaa". <br>
            
            Example 2A: I'll call her.(Ami taake DAkbo.) <br>
            Example 2B -- I'll visit her.(Ami tAr sange dekhA korbo.) <br>
            Example 2C -- I'll call on her.(Ami tAr sange dekhA korbo.)<br>
            
            <br>
          
                        
            <span class="example">Example #1: </span>
            <span class="highlight">look after [ verb + preposition ]</span><br>
            The meaning of "look after" is "to take care". 
            <br><br>
            
            <span class="example">Example #2:</span>
            <span class="highlight">look down on </span><br>
            means "to consider as inferior or unimportant". <br><br>
            
            <span class="example">Example #3:</span> 
            <span class="highlight">call off </span><br>
             means "to cancel". <br><br>
            
            <span class="example">Example #4:</span> 
            <span class="highlight">call on </span><br>
            stands for "to pay a visit to someone".<br><br>
            
            <span class="example">Example #5:</span> 
            <span class="highlight">give up</span><br>
            means "to stop trying, quit".<br><br>
            
            <span class="example">Example #6:</span> 
            <span class="highlight">give away</span><br>
            means "to give something to somebody unconditionally". <br>

            [Note: A preposition and a particle look similar but we use them differently.<br>
            (i)  We use “preposition” (which shows a link or connection) in a “prepositional phrase.<br>
            (ii) The “particle” functions as a part of the verb. It changes the meaning of the verb to form a phrasal verb.]<br><br>
