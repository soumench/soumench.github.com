<p>You know I have a magic furniture that can speak. So I asked him earlier today : <br>
I: Hey Furni! I need your help. I want to store something in one of your drawers.<br> 
Furniture : Sure! Which drawer do you want to store in? Just tell me the name of the label so that I can find it for you.<br>
I: Let me think. Okay, I want that drawer labeled as "kukur". <br>
F: Great! So what do you want to put inside that drawer? <br>
I: I want to put the English translation "dog" of the Bengali word "kukur". <br>
F: Your wish is my command! Hehehe. Now please listen carefully - when you want your thing back just tell me the label name, okay? I will instantly give your things back to you then. <br>
I: I understand. Thank you so much, Furni.</p>

         <p>In my furniture, each drawer has a label and all the labels are different. We have to say what we want to save, and in which drawer we want it saved. Then to recover it we ask for the contents of that drawer.</p>
         <p><br>-----------------------------------------------------<br></p>
         <p><b>IMPORTANT :</b> In computer parlance, a drawer label is called a <span class="tt">key</span>, and its contents are called a <span class="tt">value</span>.</p>
