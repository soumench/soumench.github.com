        SCRIPT 4:  <br> 
         <pre>
         "use strict"; 
         var kukur; 
         kukur="dog"; 
         document.write(kukur)
          </pre>   
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Please look at the script above. You will find four things. <br><br>
        1. In the very first line we see this : "use strict" <br>
        When we write many lines of code, this "use strict" helps us by reporting what type of errors/ mistakes we made. So it is a very useful thing to add this at the beginning of your every piece of code. <br>
        
        2. Next we see the word "var" which is a short form of the word variable data. <br>
        We can think of var as a box or container where we put various types of data such as numbers, text, list of things etc. <br>
        
        3. In the third line, we store a text called "dog" in the var "kukur"; <br>Now we  can ask the kukur,"Hey, What is stored inside you?" <br>And kukur will reply "dog". 
        
        4. Now in line 4 we write the code to do the following things : <br>
        i) We ask kukur what he stored in him. <br>
        ii) We ask javascript to display that stored thing at the end of our page. <br>       
    </p>
