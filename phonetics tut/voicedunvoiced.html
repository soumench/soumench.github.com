            <h2>Part 1: What is a Spectrogram?</h2>
            <div>
            
                A spectrogram is a visual representation of the air vibration caused by any sound. <br>
                We can visually represent a speech sound taking the help of Spectrogram in Phonetics. <br>
                
                
                I used two spectrogram generating software -  Wasp and Praat to make the following images.<br>

            <h2>Part 2: How can we tell apart a vowel from a consonant in the above graphs?</h2>
               <p> Vowels have more energy.  </p>           
            
            <h2>Part 3: How vowels appear in a spectrogram </h2>
            <p>
            Here is an audio clip - a Bengali translation of "The cat went to the market." ( "biRAlTi bAjAre giyechilo").<br>
                <button onclick="play_sound();">Click me to play the sound.</button><br>
                The spectrograms of this clip is found in Fig:1 and Fig:2            
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
                This clip contains both vowel and consonant sounds. Vowel sounds have more energy.<br>
                
               Fig:1 ( The image below is made with Wasp. ) <br>

            <h2>Part 4:</h2>
            <p>
                  The consonants dA and dhA  are "voiced" consonants. <br>
                That means our vocal cord buzzes and the buzzing sound can be felt and heard. Even if the buzzing sound is 20 dB lower, it can be heard! <br>
                In a sprctrogram, this buzz can be seen near the base  frequncy of our vocal chord vibration. Mine showed a span of 75 Hz to 370 HZ in dA and dhA. <br>

                Also the volume curve  / sound pressure level curve ( the yellow curve in Praat)  is not completely down / closed. <br>
                
                
               
                But in the case of tA and thA, there are no voiced bars at the bottom part. <br>

                The yellow volume curve / sound pressure level curve is completely down. That means there is no sound output. 
                The consonant tA and thA are blocking all the sound output from our mouth. <br>

                This is the typical characteristics of a consonant. They do not sound unless they are accompanied by a vowel or semi-vowel.
