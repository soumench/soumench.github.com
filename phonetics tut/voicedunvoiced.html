            <h2>Part 1: What is a Spectrogram?</h2>
            <div>
            
                A spectrogram is a visual representation of a sound. <br>
                The renowned scientist Thomas Alva Edison, an American inventor and businessman, made an interesting device called Phonograph.
                Simply speaking, a phonograph is a sound recording device.
                And it is unique because it is the first device that was able to successfully reproduce the recorded sound.
                It records the sounds that are uttered or produced in front of it. It records them as grooves on a tinfoil with its recording mechanism. Basically, grooves show air pressure at different moments of time. The phonograph then plays the recording back with the help of its playing mechanism.<br>
                
                Nowadays, with the advancement of science, we can easily do the sound recording using our computers or phones. We also can clearly reproduce it. Computer can show those sound pressures along with other information in a simple graph. We call it “waveform”. If we want more advanced information on that recorded sound, we create “spectrograms” using our computers.
                
                
                Example. I recorded a sound file with the Bengali sentence  <button onclick="play_sound();"><h3>biRAlTi bAjAre giyechilo</h3></button> (Never mind meaning.)<br>
                Then I turned it into graphics using two different pieces of software, and I got these four graphs; all of them represent the same sound, but in different ways.<br>
                
                
                
                <div id="imgbox">
                    <div style="width:350px; float:left;">
                    <img src="voiced-unvoiced/wasp%20biral%20wide%20and%20narrow.jpg" alt="wasp img" width="400" height="300"><br>Fig:1 (made with wasp)

            </div>
                    
            
            <h2>Part 2: How can we tell apart a vowel from a consonant in the above graphs?</h2>
            <p>The vowels and the CH have lost of energy there and the other consonants have little or none. 
            </p> 
            
                    
            
            <h2>Part 3: How vowels appear in a spectrogram </h2>
            <p>This  <button onclick="play_sound();"><h3>biRAlTi bAjAre giyechilo</h3></button> clip contains both vowel and consonant sounds. Vowel sounds have more energy.<br>

                <img src="voiced-unvoiced/wasp%20biral%20wide%20and%20narrow%20-%20LABELED.jpg" alt="wasp img" width="800" height="600"><br>
                
                 Fig:2 (The image below is made with Praat.)<br>

            </p>
            
                      
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h2>Part 4:</h2>
            <p>
                The consonants dA and dhA  are "voiced" consonants. <br>
                That means our vocal cord buzzes and the buzzing sound can be felt and heard. Even if the buzzing sound is 20 dB lower, it can be heard! <br>
                In a sprctrogram, this buzz can be seen near the base  frequncy of our vocal chord vibration. Mine showed a span of 75 Hz to 370 HZ in dA and dhA. <br>

                Also the volume curve  / sound pressure level curve ( the yellow curve in Praat)  is not completely down / closed. <br>
                
                
               
                But in the case of tA and thA, there are no voiced bars at the bottom part. <br>

                The yellow volume curve / sound pressure level curve is completely down. That means there is no sound output. 
                The consonant tA and thA are blocking all the sound output from our mouth. <br>

                This is the typical characteristics of a consonant. They do not sound unless they are accompanied by a vowel or semi-vowel.
