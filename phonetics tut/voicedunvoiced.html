        <h1>Voiced and Unvoiced Consonants</h1>
        
        <div id="vuv">
            <p>
                A spectrogram is a visual representation of any sound. <br>
                We can visually represent consonants taking the help of Spectrogram and Phonetics. <br>
                I have used two spectrogram generating software -  Wasp and Praat. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Here is an audio clip - a Bengali translation of "The cat went to the market." ( "biRAlTi bAjAre giyechilo").<br>
                Let's make spectrograms of this. <br>
                <button onclick="play_sound()">Click me to play the sound.</button><br>
                The image below is made with wasp.<br>
                <img src="voiced-unvoiced/wasp%20biral%20wide%20and%20narrow.jpg" alt="wasp img" width="800" height="600"><br>
                 The image below is made with Praat.<br>
                <img src="voiced-unvoiced/praat%20biral%20wide%20and%20narrow.jpg" alt="wasp img" width="800" height="600"><br>
                
            
            </p>
            <p>
                dA  dhA   tA   thA > at first the graphs will look identical.  But upon meticulous inspection here are the following differences: <br>

                The consonants dA and dhA  are "voiced" consonants. <br>
                That means our vocal cord buzzes and the buzzing sound can be felt and heard. Even if the buzzing sound is 20 dB lower, it can be heard! <br>
                In a sprctrogram, this buzz can be seen near the base  frequncy of our vocal chord vibration. Mine showed a span of 75 Hz to 370 HZ in dA and dhA. <br>

                Also the volume curve  / sound pressure level curve ( the yellow curve in Praat)  is not completely down / closed. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But in the case of tA and thA, there are no voiced bars at the bottom part. <br>

                The yellow volume curve / sound pressure level curve is completely down. That means there is no sound output. 
                The consonant tA and thA are blocking all the sound output from our mouth. <br>

                This is the typical characteristics of a consonant. They do not sound unless they are accompanied by a vowel or semi-vowel.
