        Using computers, we can record the the sounds( the air pressures created by the vibration of any object or animal)  and display them graphically in "waveform". <br>
        Each sound has a frequency. That simply means things that vibrate make sounds. If the vibration is from 20 times a second to 20000 a second, many of us normally can hear it.  <br>
        The picture below shows a recorded sound.<br> <!--picture here-->
        How was it recorded? <br>
        I recorded the sound of a tuning fork. Upon hitting the tuning fork, there was an audible vibration. The vibration of the tuning fork itself caused some movements / vibration  in the air near it. Then I placed my microphone near it. And that air vibration hit the diaphragm of the microphone, the microphone generated some electrical signals from the mechanical vibrations of its diaphragm. My audio recording software in the computer converted that electric signal into waveform which is actually the recorded sound of the tuning fork.<br>
        
        The number of waves per second in the graph has to do with the "pitch" of the sound. The more waves per second are seen, the more shrill the sound is.<br>
        The height of the waves has to do with the loudness. They tell us how loud or low is the volume of the recorded sound.<br> 
        The shape of the waves has to do with timbre. Timbre is an interesting sound property.
