     <!--   
      the reason that i asked you to make three cuts of the original sound, all 10ms long, starting at 600ms, 700ms, and 800ms
 is that we want to see if the waveform changes or not
 also, i want your page to explain what we are seeing in every of the graphs
 one must say pure tone
 this way we will still be able to suse the dsame graphs tomorrow when you will have probably forgotten the filenames-->
