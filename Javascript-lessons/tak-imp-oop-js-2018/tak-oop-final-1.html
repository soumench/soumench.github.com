        <!--<h1>Lesson 1</h1>-->
        
        
        <div class="q">What is an 'Object'?</div>
        <p>In a computer program, an 'object' is  like a furniture with many lockers in which we store some data.</p><br><br>
         
        
        
        <div class="q">How do we store data inside an 'object'?</div>
        <div class="flex-container">
        <div>In a furniture, each drawer has a label and all the labels  are different.
            We have to say what we want to save, and in which drawer we want it saved. Then to recover it we ask for the contents of that drawer.
            In computer parlance, a drawer label is called a <span class="tt">key</span>, and its contents are called a <span class="tt">value</span>.</div>
             
         <div><img  class="img" alt="locker" src="img/locker.jpg" width="100" height="100"></div>
         <div>
             <p>
         Let's say we want an 'object' and then we want to put the English translations of some Bengali words in it.  
            <br>We tell the furniture, please put the word "dog" into the drawer that has label "kukur". After a while we ask the furniture, read to me what you have in the drawer 'kukur' and the furniture replies "dog".</p> <p>  
            Now "dog" is said to be a value, and  the "kukur" that we use to retrieve the value is said to be a key.
        <!--In this way, you have a way of saving the <span class="val">data "dog"</span> under the <span class="key">key "kukur"</span> into that 'object'.--></p>
        </div>
        </div>
        <br><br>
        
        
        
        
        <div class="q">What happens if we ask the furniture to put "cat" into the "biRAl" drawer, and there is no drawer with that label?</div>
        <p>The furniture will create a new drawer labelled as "biRal" and then put the word "cat" inside it. </p><br><br>
        
        
        
        
        
        <div class="q">What happens if we ask the locker to put "cat" into the "biRAl" drawer, and there is already drawer with that label? Does the word "cat" get added to the end of what is already in the drawer, maybe?</div>
        <p>The earlier contents of the "biRal" drawer will be emptied and the new word "cat" will be added to that "biRal" drawer. </p><br><br>
        
        
        
        
         <div class="q">What happens if we ask what did we put in the drawer the word "bhAluk", and there is no drawer of that name because we never put anything in it? Will the furniture maybe google for the translation of "bAluk" and tell us that it is "bear".</div>
        <p>
            When we do that, the furniture will give us a special thing called undefined.  
        </p><br><br>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <div class="q">So if we ask a furniture for the value of it drawer "xxx" and it gives us 'undefined'; Does that mean that there is no drawer of that name?</div>
        <p>Sometimes it does, but not always. The furniture gives us 'undefined' when we ask for the contents of a drawer that does not exist. But it also gives us 'undefined', if the drawer does exist and we put earler "undefined" inside that drawer. By the way, putting 'undefined' inside a drawer is usually a bad idea.</p><br><br>
        
        
        
        
        
        <div class="q">Can we tell the furniture to delete a drawer?</div>
        <p>  When we tell the furniture to delete a drawer, it obeys us like a good boy. It deletes the drawer and its contents.
        </p><br><br>
        
        
        
       <!--<div class="q"> how do we recover the data we saved inside an 'object'?</div>
       <p>
          Whenever we ask the 'object' for the contents of the <span class="key">key</span> kukkur, it will give us a fresh copy of that.<br>
          And if you ask again, you get the same thing again, <b>the 'object' never forgets</b>.</p>--><br><br>
        
        
        
       <!-- <div class="q"> What if we ask for the contents of a drawer but we did not put it inside the 'object' earlier?</div> 
        <p>               
            The 'object' gives us a thing called 'undefined'.
        </p>
