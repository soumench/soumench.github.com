        <!--<h1>Lesson 1</h1>-->
        
        
        <div class="q">1. What is an 'Object'?</div>
        <p>In a computer program, an 'object' is something in which we store some data.</p><br><br>
         
        
        
        <div class="q">2. How do we store data inside an 'object'?</div>
        <p>When we put data in the 'object', we have to say a <span class="key">"key"</span>, and the data.<br>
            And to recover the data, we have to give the <span class="key">key</span>.<br>
         <!--<img src="img/keyndata.jpg" alt="key&data" width="100" height="100" class="img"> <br>  -->
            We can compare an 'object' with a furniture with many lockers. Each drawer has a label and all the labels are different. <br> 
         <img  class="img" alt="locker" src="img/locker.jpg" width="100" height="100"><br>
            
         Let's say we want an 'object' and then we want to put the English translations of some Bengali Words in it.  
            <br>We tell the furniture, please put the word <span class="val">"dog"</span> into the drawer that has label <span class="key">"kukur"</span>. After a while we ask the furniture, read to me what you have in the drawer <span class="key">'kukur'</span> and the furniture replies <span class="val">"dog"</span>.<br>   
            Now <span class="val">"dog"</span> is said to be a <span class="val">value</span>, and  the <span class="key">"kukur"</span> that we use to retrieve the value is said to be a <span class="key">"key"</span>.
        <!--In this way, you have a way of saving the <span class="val">data "dog"</span> under the <span class="key">key "kukur"</span> into that 'object'.--><br></p><br><br>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <div class="q">3. What happens if we ask the locker to put "cat" into the "biRAl" drawer, and there is no drawer with that label?</div>
        <p></p>
        
        
        
        
        
        <div class="q">4. What happens if we ask the locker to put "cat" into the "biRAl" drawer, and there is already drawer with that label? Does the cat get added to the end of what is already in the drawer, maybe?</div>
        <p></p>
        
        
        
        
         <div class="q">5.  What happens if we ask what did we put in the drawer bAluk, and there is no drawer of that name because we never put anything in it? Will the furniture maybe google for thetranslation of bAluk and tell us that it is "bear"</div>
        <p></p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
       <!--<div class="q">4. how do we recover the data we saved inside an 'object'?</div>
       <p>
          Whenever we ask the 'object' for the contents of the <span class="key">key</span> kukkur, it will give us a fresh copy of that.<br>
          And if you ask again, you get the same thing again, <b>the 'object' never forgets</b>.</p>--><br><br>
        
        
        
       <!-- <div class="q">5. What if we ask for the contents of a drawer but we did not put it inside the 'object' earlier?</div> 
        <p>               
            The 'object' gives us a thing called 'undefined'.
        </p>
