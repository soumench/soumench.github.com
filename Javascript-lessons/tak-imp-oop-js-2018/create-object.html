  We are going to make our first JS script.
 Our script is going to do the folloing things:<br>
 First it will create two objects.<br>
 Then it will make a drawer in one of the objects, with the key "kukur" and the value "dog";
 then it makes another drawer with key biRAl and value whatever.

 Then we tell javascript to add whatever it finds in the kukur locker to the end of the current document.
 The script will look like this --<br>
 and ten you wrote the script
<div class="code">
<pre>
var b2e={};
var ben2eng={};

b2e["kukur"]="dog";
b2e["biRAl"]="cat";
document.write(b2e["kukur"]);
</pre>        
</div>
Follow this link to see the script in action.<br>
        
         "Now this script needs some explanation. We'll explain the "use strict" and the var words later. <br> the var b2e ={} ; line does two things. The {} thing creates a new furniture that has no drawers. And then the b2e= at the left allows us to use in the script the name b2e to mean that object. <br>
        (next line) the line b2e["kukur"]="dog"; puts the value "dog" inside the drawrer "kukur". The last line document.write(b2e["kukur"]+ "<br>"); gets the content of the drawer kukur and appends it to the end of the page, followed by a <br>
        
 hint: when you use a "bevel" border , the top and left of the bevel must be slightly clearer than the page background, and the bottom and right must be slightly darker.
 do not uise pure black in a bevel
