        <h1>Lesson 2</h1>
        
        <span class="q">5. What if I write a new <span class="val">value</span> of a <span class="key">key</span> inside an object?</span> <br>
        <p>Now if you tell the object that the <span class="val">value</span> of kukkur has to be "hound".
            It will completely forget the previous <span class="val">value</span>, and from then on whenever you ask for kukkur, it will say hound.
        </p>
        
            
        
        
        
        <span class="q">6. Can I fix something that I have mistakenly stored in an object?</span> <br>
        <p>Now what happens if you decide that 'kukkur' was a mistake and it should have been 'kukur'?<br>
            <b>Here is no way that you can change a </b><span class="key">key</span>. <br>
            But you can <b>add</b> a new <span class="key">key 'kukur'</span>  giving it the <span class="val">value 'dog'</span>. <br>
            and you <b>erase</b> both the old <span class="key">key</span> 'kukkur' and its <span class="val">value</span>.
        </p><br>
  
        
        
        
        
        <span class="q">7. What happens when we delete a key?</span> <br>
        <p>If you delete a <span class="key">key</span> the locker disappears along with its contents.<br>
            If you set the value of the <span class="key">key</span> to undefined the locker is still there but it has an undefined thing inside. <br>
            In either case if you ask the object what is the <span class="val">value</span> of that <span class="key">key</span>, it will give you an undefined, doesnt matter if it is the undefined that it found inside a loker, or if there is no locker with such a <span class="key">key</span>.
            'undefined' is a value. It is a value that will usually mean "unknown" but it is a <span class="val">value </span>anyway.
