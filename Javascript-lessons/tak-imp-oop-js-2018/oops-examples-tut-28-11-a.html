	<body><span class="q">1. What is an Object?</span><br> 
        <p>In a computer program, an object is something that we use to store data in it.</p>
        
        
        
        <span class="q">2. How do we store data inside an object?</span> <br>
        <p>When we put data in the object, we have to say a <span class="key">"key"</span>, and the data.<br>
            And to recover the data, we have to give the <span class="key">key</span>.<br>
         <img src="img/keyndata.jpg" alt="key&data" width="100" height="100" class="img"> <br>  
            We can compare an object with a furniture with many lockers. Each locker has a unique <span class="key">key</span> to access what is inside.<br> 
         <img  class="img" alt="locker" src="img/locker.jpg" width="100" height="100"><br>
        
        Lets see that we want an object to keep in it English translations of Bengali words.<br>     
        We can give that object a name, or several names. For instance, it might be called bengalienglishdictionary, or b2e.<br>
            Then you have a way of saving the data "dog" under the <span class="key">key "kukur"</span> into that object.<br>
            Now if you ask the object what is the <span class="val">value</span> of <span class="key">key</span> kukkur, it will say dog.<br>
        And if you ask again, you get the same thing again, the object never forgets.</p>
        
        
        
        <span class="q">3. What if I write a new <span class="val">value</span> of a <span class="key">key</span> inside an object?</span> <br>
        <p>Now if you tell the object that the <span class="val">value</span> of kukkur has to be "hound".
            It will completely forget the previous <span class="val">value</span>, and from then on whenever you ask for kukkur, it will say hound.
        </p>
        
        
        
        <span class="q">4. What happens when there is nothing stored inside an object?</span> <br>
        <p>Now what happens if you ask the object what is the <span class="val">value</span> or biRal, when you never told it earlier what the <span class="val">value</span> of biRal should be?<br>  
        It will give you 'undefined', which is just a way of sayng,'Hey, you never told me earlier!'.
        </p>
        
        
        
        <span class="q">5. Can I fix something that I have mistakenly stored in an object?</span> <br>
        <p>Now what happens if you decide that 'kukkur' was a mistake and it should have been 'kukur'?<br>
            Here is no way that you can change a <span class="key">key</span>. <br>
            But you can add a new <span class="key">key 'kukur'</span>  giving it the <span class="val">value 'dog'</span>. <br>
            and you erase both the old <span class="key">key</span> 'kukkur' and its <span class="val">value</span>.
        </p><br>
  
        
        So there is a lot of things that you can say about saving and recovering.<br><br>
        
        
        
        <span class="q">6. What happens when we delete a key?</span> <br>
        <p>If you delete a <span class="key">key</span> the locker disappears along with its contents.<br>
            If you set the value of the <span class="key">key</span> to undefined the locker is still there but it has an undefined thing inside. <br>
            In either case if you ask the object what is the <span class="val">value</span> of that <span class="key">key</span>, it will give you an undefined, doesnt matter if it is the undefined that it found inside a loker, or if there is no locker with such a <span class="key">key</span>.
            'undefined' is a value. It is a value that will usually mean "unknown" but it is a <span class="val">value </span>anyway.
        </p><br>

 <!--           11:29]  wthout having to use algebra
[11:29]  kindly allow me to copy it
[11:29]  and use it
[11:29]  moment
[11:30]  you have to improve it

[11:30]  tell me somthign later
[11:31]  what is the difference between b2e.kukkur=undefined
[11:31]  and delete b2e.kukkur ?
[11:31]  not sure
[11:31]  hen you didnt understand what i typed above

[11:32]  oh , let me read
[11:32]  i said that you can give a new value to a key
[11:32]  and that you can delete a key
[11:32]  yes
[11:32]  and that if you ask for the value of a key that is not there you get undefined
[11:34]  so we can add a key without a value?
[11:34]  did i say that?
[11:34]  afaik i said that you can add a key only at the same time you add its value
[11:35]  then how b2e.kukur=undefined
[11:35]  undefined is a value
[11:35]  undefiend is a datatype
[11:35]  oh okay
[11:35]  it isa value that will usually mean "unknown"
[11:36]  okay
[11:36]  but it is a value anyway
[11:36]  okay
[11:36]  now listen
[11:36]  yes please
[11:37]  if you cannot figure out from an explanation what is the difference between removing a key with its value, and updating the current value of a key to the undefined value,
[11:37]  how you can expect that an 8yearold will understand it magically when you write it with algebra formulas?
[11:37]  true
[11:37]  you must FIRST explain what we are doing
[11:38]  afterwards we will explain how to write it
            [11:38]  if you just read the code and try to figure out intuitively what it should nean
[11:38]  the result is invariably that you get stupid ideas like "var x=o ; makesa copy of the object"
[11:39]  now back to my example

        
        -->
<!--        
        [11:39]  if you delete a key the locker disappears along with its contents
[11:40]  if you set the value of the key to undefined the locker is still there but it has an undefined thing inside
[11:41]  in either case if you ask the object what is the value of that key, it will give you an undefined, doesnt matter if it
[11:41]  is teh undefined that it found inside a loker, or if there is no locker with such a key
[11:42]  thisi sconfusing enough explained like i explained it
[11:42]  if you try to explain it using lines o code that the reader has nevr seen earlier, you will invariably confuse them
[11:43]  later
[11:43]  yes please
[11:44]  wat is better, erasing a key by object.key=undefined, or with delete object.key?
[11:44]  delete
[11:44]  why?
[11:44]  undefined is of no use,  it will consume more memory
[11:45]  yes, either way, object.kukkur will give undefined, but the kukkur takes up space
[11:46]  however if yu have learned JS just by trying todo things and printing the result with console.log you will never understand that difference
[11:47]  you need the eplanation to know what is going on "under the hood"
[11:47]  question
[11:47]  so true
[11:47]  do you know how to ue JS to tell the difference between an object taht has a kukkur locker with value undefined, and an object that has no kukkur locker at all?
[11:48]  idk
[11:48]  you cannotdo console.log(object.kukkur) because either way you get undefined
[11:48]  can that bedone?
[11:49]  idk
[11:49]  me too idk

[11:49]  google for that afterwards
[11:49]  ok
[11:49]  Perl allows you to do that
[11:50]  so i guess JS allows that too
[11:50]  but ou cannot do it using only what we'll teach in thefirst lesson
[11:50]  another question
[11:50]  if you have an object
[11:51]  and you do console.log(object.kukur) and you get dog
[11:51]  does that invariably mean that the object has a kukur drawer?
[11:51]  yes
[11:51]  no
[11:52]  but we'll teach that in lesson 4:  prototypes
[11:52]  oh
[11:52]  i am wonderstruck
[11:52]  by what?
[11:53]  how beautiful
[11:53]  its a beautiful thing how it works
[11:53]  you say you only teach elders
[11:53]  but rarely explained in tutorials
[11:54]  and i do
[11:54]  yet the principles of teaching are always the same
[11:54]  you startwith the basic things
[11:55]  and whenthey are too removed from everyday experience
[11:55]  you find some way to relate the things you describe with nown things
[11:56]  everybody can understand the idea of drawers with labels in them
[11:56]  our next step is turning them into "magic chest"
            [11:56]  so that if you tell the chest "kepp this 5 in drawer kukkur" it will make a drawer kukkur even if it does not have one
[11:57]  is there a way of getting a list of all keys in a chest?
[11:58]  yes
[11:58]  for each, may be?
[11:58]  dk, thats why i ask you
[11:58]  okay
[11:58]  our next chapter will be
[11:58]  names
[11:59]  objects properly speaking do NOT have names
[11:59]  but when we build an object we can give it as many names as we want        
  [12:00]  what do we need names for?
[12:01]  to show objects inside object?
[12:02]  we need names in order to write the JS commands that will save values inside an object and will recover copies of the value
[12:02]  now we ae starting to explainthe JS algebra
[12:03]  oh
[12:03]  and we start that by showing a very short script and explain what each line does
[12:04]  the first line creates an object and gives it the name b2e
[12:04]  the second line creates another object and gives it the name e2b
[12:05]  the next line gives the first object a key "kukur" and gives it the value "dog"
[12:06]  the next line asks the FIRST object for the value of its kukur property and adds it to the document followed by "<br>"
[12:06]  the next line asks the SECOND object for the value of its dog property and adds it to the document followed by "<br>"      
 [12:07]  of course as we never gave a dog key to thesecond object,it will give us undefined       
        
        </p>-->
        var mylockers={};<br>
        <p>
            It creates an empty object with no keys, and therefore no values 
            (because each value hangs from a key).
       </p>
         mylockers[""]=5;  
        <p>Now the object o has a key "" whose value is 5</p>
        mylockers["age"]=12;
        <p>Now the object o has a key "age" whose value is 12.<br><br>
        Now we can see which things are stored inside our object.

                //then the object gets a new key
                //the "key" is age and its value is 8
                ///******* we store things inside objects, always under a name
                //and if we know how to getto the object, and we know the key, we can recover a copy of the thing
        document.write(o[""]);
        
        /*we can do the following operations on an object
        Create, read, update and delete
        and we do it in this way:*/
        
        var student = {roll:2, age:12}; // created two keys
        console.log(student); // read keys
        student.class=6; // added another key 'class:6'
        console.log(student);
        student.roll=21; // update a key
        console.log(student);
        delete student.age;  // delete a key
        student["age"]=15;
