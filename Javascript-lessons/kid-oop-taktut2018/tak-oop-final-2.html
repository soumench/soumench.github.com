      <!--  <div class="q">7. What if I write a new <span class="val">value</span> of a <span class="key">key</span> inside an object?</div> 
        <p>Now if you tell the object that the <span class="val">value</span> of kukkur has to be "hound".
            It will completely forget the previous <span class="val">value</span>, and from then on whenever you ask for kukkur, it will say hound.
        </p><br><br>
        
            
        
        
        
        <div class="q">8. Can I fix something that I have mistakenly stored in an object?</div>
        <p>Now what happens if you decide that 'kukkur' was a mistake and it should have been 'kukur'?<br>
            <b>Here is no way that you can change a </b><span class="key">key</span>. <br>
            But you can <b>add</b> a new <span class="key">key 'kukur'</span>  giving it the <span class="val">value 'dog'</span>. <br>
            And you <b>erase</b> both the old <span class="key">key</span> 'kukkur' and its <span class="val">value</span>.
        </p><br><br>
  
        
        
        
        
        <div class="q">9. What happens when we delete a key?</div>
        <p>If you delete a <span class="key">key</span> the locker disappears along with its contents.<br>
            If you set the value of the <span class="key">key</span> to undefined the locker is still there but it has an undefined thing inside. <br>
            In either case if you ask the object what is the <span class="val">value</span> of that <span class="key">key</span>, it will give you an undefined, doesnt matter if it is the undefined that it found inside a loker, or if there is no locker with such a <span class="key">key</span>.
            'undefined' is a value. It is a value that will usually mean "unknown" but it is a <span class="val">value </span>anyway.

<!--<p>You know I have a magic furniture that can speak. So I asked him earlier today : <br>
I: Hey Furni! I need your help. I want to store something in one of your drawers.<br> 
Furniture : Sure! Which drawer do you want to store in? Just tell me the name of the label so that I can find it for you.<br>
I: Let me think. Okay, I want that drawer labeled as "kukur". <br>
F: Great! So what do you want to put inside that drawer? <br>
I: I want to put the English translation "dog" of the Bengali word "kukur". <br>
F: Your wish is my command! Hehehe. Now please listen carefully - when you want your thing back just tell me the label name, okay? I will instantly give your things back to you then. <br>
I: I understand. Thank you so much, Furni.</p>

         <p>In my furniture, each drawer has a label and all the labels are different. We have to say what we want to save, and in which drawer we want it saved. Then to recover it we ask for the contents of that drawer.</p>
         <p><br>-----------------------------------------------------<br></p>
         <p><b>IMPORTANT :</b> In computer parlance, a drawer label is called a <span class="tt">key</span>, and its contents are called a <span class="tt">value</span>.</p>
