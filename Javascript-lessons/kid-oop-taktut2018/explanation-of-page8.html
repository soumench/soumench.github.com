       <!-- [11:57] Takni Mistwalker: you haveto explain that when you type kukkur="fog", that is just short for window.kukkur="dog"
[11:57] Takni Mistwalker: also you have to explain that window.test is just a way of asking for a copy of the contents of the drawer test of object window
[11:58] Takni Mistwalker: you also have to explain that in document.write(test), the word test is juts a way of saying that you want the cvalue of the drawer test of the object window put in here
