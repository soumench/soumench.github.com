1. the general idea here is that we can find rAma in a dictionary then you add the s to turn it into a doer word


2. and this way you get the doer word rAmas

3. things like rAma kAka kapi are found in dictionaries, but they are not words, because we need to add something to them before we can use them in a sentence
 a) when we add s to them we get doer words
 b) when we add m to them we get karma words
