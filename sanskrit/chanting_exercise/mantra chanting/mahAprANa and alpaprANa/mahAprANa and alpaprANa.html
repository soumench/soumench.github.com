        A pAda is a set of eight syllables -- here the sound of ONLY the first pAda, namely sarasvatimahAbhAge is presented in the spectrogram.

       <h3>some theory</h3>   
            
             It is a characteristic of Bengali phonetics and of Sanskrit phonetics too, that when pronouncing the letters b bh g gh k kh p T t d dh th etc etc. <br><br>
there is a slight indcrease of pressure after the tonguie while the tongue is stopping the pass of air  so that when the tongue opens again, the accumulated air goes out suddenly, making a sound that I call a "puff", but the old teachers called prANa  which simply means "air" or "wind". <br>
 In modern Western phonetics that sound is called either an "aspiration" or a "murmur"
 and if you want you may look at the wikipedia pages that explain these two words, when applied to phonetics.<br><br><br>
 Now if you look carefully at the part of your gram where you said "bhA" -  you can see that there are three vertical stripes ;  the white vertical bar is the first part of the bh  sound -- iy is  time in which the tongue is obstructing completely the pass of air. <br>
 after that you have TWO dark areas that are very easy to confuse which each other. <br>
            
             The first part is the prANa, the air that is being released suddenly
 and the second part is the A vowel. <br><br><br>
            
             You can see the difference mainly in the yellow curve and in the blue curve <br><br>
            
             Also, the prANa part looks like more "fuzzy" and the vowel part looks like more "sharp" -- they have different graphic textures. <br>
            
            The exact same thing happens in the "ti" and in the "ge" parts of the gram, but that is harder to see, because the prANa here is MUCH narrower

        The purple rectangles with very tiny borders around all the prANa bars.<br>
            Here are three prANa bars :
            <ol>
                <li>between t and i</li>
                <li>between bh's white bar and A</li>
                <li>and finally between g and e</li>
            </ol>
        <img src="prANa-1.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""><br>
        the hiss sound after b is far longer than the hisssound after t g <br>
 that is why the hiss after bh is called mahAprANa and the hiss after t g is alpaprANa
