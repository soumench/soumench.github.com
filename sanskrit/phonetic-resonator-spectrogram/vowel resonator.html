    <h1>vowel resonator></h1>
        <h2>oo</h2>
        <audio controls>
            <p>In "oo" gram below, the software malfunctioned.It failed to represent the correct formants. The actual formants are f1 400,  f2 1000 and f3 2500</p>

        <h2>ih</h2>
        <p>in ih gram, f1 is at around 411Hz and the f2 is at about 1998 Hz</p>

        <h2>ah</h2>
        <p> in ah gram - f1 is at about 320 Hz , f2 is about 722Hz</p>

        <h1>ih-ah-oo by me</h1>

       Roughly   i ( f1 = 300Hz, f2 = 2200 Hz), aa ( f1 = 630Hz, f3= 1200Hz), oo ( f1= 400 Hz, f2 =  f2 = 900Hz)
        <p>
         these three are called the "cardinal vowels" for some reason
It is extremely easy to tell apart 'i' from 'a'; <br>
but telling apart 'a' from 'u' is a bit harder, as the only difference is that the 'u' formants are a bit lower than the 'a' formants
        </p>
        <p>
         If anything sounds roughly like a 'i' or 'u',  then it will have formants roughly like these.</p>
        <p> in the i the f1 and f2 are far apart</p>
        <p>in the a they are close together</p>
        <p> in the u they are close together, but lower than the a</p>
        
        <p>
        So int the grams of the three flutes, 
we expect to see the same formants
 BUT  they will be slightly higher, because those flutes are too small to simulate your voice.
        </p>
        
        <p>
         <b>second point and very important</b>
        </p>
        <p> formants will always be at the same height regardless of fundamental frequency of input</p>
        <p> because resonant frequency of a cavity depends only in itsshape</p>
        
        <p>
         once you put your tongue in the ih position  freqs near 300 and 2200 will be strengthened and freqs near 1000 will be weakended
        </p>
        
        <p> regardless of how you make your cavity resonate,  you can use vocal chords to make air vibrate,  or a jew's harp, or blow into a didgeridoo,  or put in a live bee,  regardless of the vibrations that come in,  if anything is near 300 or 2000 will resonate, near 1000 it will be deafened</p>
